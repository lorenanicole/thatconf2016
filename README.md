###What is Io trivia night? The funnest way to learn Io!

Are you a trivia champion? Perhaps you're looking to up your game with some trivia about prototype languages and meta programming. Well, look no further! We'll walk through writing a small trivia DSL tool in Io, a prototype language with minimal syntax and rules, and in the process play a little trivia. Io's simple syntax allows us to take treat our program as data and modify it while we use it.  

Bring your thinking caps and questions - we are going to do a little trivia to learn the basics of Io and see why metaprogramming is so fun!
