###What is Io trivia night? The funnest way to learn Io!

Are you a trivia champion? Perhaps you're looking to up your game with some trivia about about prototype languages (and meta programming). Well, look no further! We'll walk through writing a small trivia game in Io, a prototype language with minimal syntax and rules, and in the process play a little trivia. Fun fact - Io's simple syntax allows us to take treat our program as data and modify it while we use it.

Bring your thinking caps and questions (yes, you can submit your own questions) - we are going to do a little trivia to learn the basics of Io and see why programming in it is so fun!
